### 👨‍💻 About Me  

**B.Tech (Information Technology)** student at **Noida Institute of Engineering and Technology**, passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems.  

I enjoy learning how systems work — from AI-based automation to full-stack web development.  
Over the past few years, I’ve built and published projects that combine **machine learning, computer vision, and web technologies** into practical solutions.  

Right now, I’m improving my skills in **AI, Machine Learning, and Full Stack Development (MERN)** while also strengthening my understanding of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in Java.
